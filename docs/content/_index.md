Proxcord is an unofficial Proxmox community on Discord. Some of the deployments / projects / bugs we work on there gets documented here. Especially this is a place to document some best practices, introductory knowledge and unconventional setups which are usually out of scope of the official documentation.

### What we are not

We are no company support. Our supportive capabilities are limited in the communities capacities. If you expect your problem to be solved yesterday, please consider buying an official enterprise subscription from [Proxmox Server Solutions](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/pricing) instead.

<--->

### What this Documentation is

This is no replacement for the official [wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki) neither for the official [docs](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/) of the [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://pve.proxmox.com). Instead this is a place to document things which are usually out of scope of the official sites.
