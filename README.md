# proxcord-docs

This is the underlying repo for the [Proxcord documentation site](https://proxcord.duckdns.org).

## What is proxcord?

Proxcord is a Discord server built as an unofficial community space around the Proxmox virtual environment. You can join [here](https://discord.gg/8R2W3jCWtw).

## What are the proxcord-docs?

If you like to try out new things on your PVE they are a space for you.

There are a lot of ways to setup or extend your PVE-hosts which are not officially supported. As a consequence we created this site to document frequent, but unconventional setups, problems and workarounds we found.

## How can I contribute?

If you think a topic is missing, please make sure:

- That it is a proxmox-related topic.
- That the official pages do not directly document the issue.

If that's the case feel free to contribute to the site.
Don't worry if the changes you commit don't take place instantly, we'll review them first.
